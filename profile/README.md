# SaaSaparilla

### What?

An opinionated collection of tools and services that a SaaS product might need for day 2 operations.

### Why?

I am tired of reimplementing these patterns, and I think they're useful.

### Current Projects

1. SaaSaparilla-bootstrap: a tool for locally developing in a k8s cluster that matches the shape of dev/production
2. SaaSaparilla-notification: a tool for sending notifications to large numbers of clients
